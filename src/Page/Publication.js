            <b>“ Racisms are all disgusting! ”</b>
            </h3>
            <p>In 2017, I was attending a Youth Program for the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals. That day was special for me, we were going to visit the DMZ. As it was an official schedule of our program, we had to wear black pants and white tops as our uniforms. I will always remember when my teammate told me: “You won’t have a problem with our team’s uniform. You are already black; you don’t need to wear black pants”. I was disgusted. It was my first genuine experience with racisms, the first time I really understood that I am different. In fact, we are all different in many aspects: age, height, weight, gender, and skin. Your skin color and mine are clearly not the same. But I have no doubt that we have different skin colors because every individual has a different amount of melanin in their body and nothing else. Thankfully, science and civilization have made us understand that even a huge difference in the amount of melanin is not enough to establish a hierarchy among us and I am really proud of all the progress we have made against racisms so far.</p>

            <p>
                Today, even though our opposition to racisms has expanded, our Korean society still has more challenges to face in order to become more racially tolerant. Recently, like many other black people, I was very moved to hear about the blackface meme from Uijeongbu High School students. To make this point a bit clearer, Blackface is when someone puts on make-up to darken his skin, wanting it to look like an existing or fictional person (a character from a film, cartoon, drama, book, etc.), even though it is supposedly done in a way to pay tribute. Let’s say it once and for all: <b>it’s not just a disguise, it’s a symbol of racisms and it’s disgusting</b>.
            </p>

            <p>
                In the 18th century, the use of blackface by white men became very popular in American theaters. As unfortunate as it was, those performers in blackface played characters that perpetuated a range of negative stereotypes about black people such as being lazy, ignorant, superstitious, hypersexual, criminal, or cowardly. It also allowed the society to routinely and historically imagine black people as not fully human, but less: a subhuman, a slave that should be dominated and made fun of. Would you close your eyes for a few seconds and imagine what it was like for all the black people living there at that time, after experiencing slavery? Now, what do you feel? I am sure that you wouldn't think about everything that went with blackface was just not funny, not bearable, and not okay to see.
            </p>

            <p>
                But, why is blackface still considered racist today? You have probably noticed that I have used the word racisms in plural on the title. It’s because I am convinced that there are many forms of racism. In fact, discriminating against a group of people and violating their dignity because of their race is racist as as using symbols that remind the historical practice of racism is. Do you remember the experience I had? The time I was told that I don’t need to wear black pants because I was black was obviously discriminatory and degrading whereas doing the blackface is a symbol of the historical and toxic culture of racism. Even so, there is no need to put them in the balance to decide which one is more or less racist than the other. Racisms, symbols, or actions, are all disgusting.
            </p>
            <p>
                Even though some of us might say that the high school students did it for fun, that they did it thinking about today’s generation, and history is in the past and we cannot change much of it, let's think twice, none of us, African, Asian, or no matter what our ethnicity is, would like to be made fun of while going through hell. Every time there is a blackface representation, it recalls slavery, the mistreatments, and all the mockeries that the black community had to experience.
            </p>
            <p>It was slavery, now what? While growing up, I’ve always been taught by my mother that our intentions when we act upon something are as much important as the effects of our actions on the people surrounding us. If we really care about getting rid of racisms, good motives are not enough, justifying our actions with good intentions only is not the best way to overcome the dormant resentment that subsists deep inside of our collective memory. If we really care about outliving racisms, we have the duty to care about the consequences of our actions on people as well. Isn’t putting to put ourselves in someone else’s shoes the golden rule? I am sure that if the students had to see things from that perspective it wouldn't have been that fun for them.  If I was asked how to end racism, I would say that yet "I am not sure how long is the road to end racism, believe me, goodwill and empathy will help us make a giant leap forward ".</p>
